# Introduction & Abstract 

## Introduction
This thesis and accompanying data visualization project examine how Louis Armstrong’s legacy has been represented, remembered, and sustained over time. His legacy is reimagined and reassessed to highlight his multi-faceted artistry and its enormity that deserves more credit than it has been given. While Armstrong is widely celebrated as a pioneering jazz musician, this project argues that his cultural impact extends far beyond music. As one of the first Black global pop stars, opening the doors to Black entertainers, an ambassador of the United States, and a major cultural figure of his time, Armstrong played a foundational role in shaping twentieth century American identity, artistic innovation, and international diplomacy.

## Abstract
The project investigates four central questions: How has Louis Armstrong’s legacy been constructed across history? Why career choices were made by Black entertainers of his time and under what historical context were their decisions tied to. What conditions have made Louis Armstrong;s influence on American culture endure for over a century? Why should his role as both a groundbreaking artist and cultural diplomat receive greater recognition? This project will draw from archival materials from the Louis Armstrong House Museum, the Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation, the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History & Culture, the Schomburg Center for Research, and public-domain audio archives between 1900–1925. The research will include historical, musical, political, and cultural data displayed as an analytical framework that answers the four central questions.

The creative component translates this research into a series of data visualizations that map the anatomy of an artist like Armstrong’s whose work crossed musical categories and roles such as musician, instrumentalist, singer, bandleader, ambassador, actor, visual artist, activist, humanitarian, husband, son and private citizen. A historical timeline sets his life (1900–1971) within broader American social and political developments, such as Prohibition and The Great Depression as well the state of global affairs, that includes Word War II, to demonstrate how jazz emerged alongside modern America and how Armstrong became central to its global cultural reputation. 

Other data visualizations examine Louis Armstrong’s career decisions, his public statements during the unrest of the Civil Rights movement, and his role as a global ambassador of American culture. The project analyzes how his international tours promoting jazz positioned him as a representative and ambassador of American freedom and creativity abroad, even as racial injustice and segregation persisted at home. These visualizations explore the tension between Armstrong’s role in projecting a preferred image of the United States to the world and the realities faced by Black Americans during the same period. By mapping performances, political events, public commentary, and media narratives, the project highlights how cultural diplomacy through jazz both advanced American power and, at times, functioned as a distraction from domestic inequalities.

Additional visual analyses examine recordings, re-recordings, performances, and media appearances to trace the evolution of Armstrong’s public image and legacy. Expanding beyond his professional life, the project also includes data visualizations of Armstrong as a collage artist, mapping themes, materials, and visual motifs across his handmade works to reveal an often overlooked dimension of his creative practice. Further visualizations situate him within his Queens neighborhood community, illustrating patterns of correspondence and local relationships to portray Armstrong as neighbor and private citizen. 

Sentiment and network analyses of interviews, tributes, and critical writings visualize how fellow musicians and cultural figures described and interpreted him over time, offering a comparative view of his reputation across generations of artists. Together, these visual frameworks broaden the understanding of Armstrong’s legacy beyond performance, positioning him as a multidimensional cultural figure whose influence resonated across artistic, social, and personal spheres.

The project combines archival research, historical analysis and AI data modeling. Primary data structures include chronological datasets, categorical taxonomies of roles, network maps of collaborations and media appearances, and geographic maps of performances and diplomatic tours. By transforming qualitative cultural history into visual data, the project goes beyond individual artifacts to reveal patterns about race, media and national identity in the twentieth century.

This thesis positions Armstrong not only as a musician but as a lens through which to understand America, culturally, politically and artistically. It contributes to the field of data visualization by showing how visualization can be used to interpret cultural history, connecting quantitative analysis with humanistic research. Addressed to scholars, data designers, historians, and the general public, the project argues for a more expansive remembrance of Louis Armstrong. Not only as a jazz icon but as a foundational figure who continues to shape contemporary music, diplomacy, and global artistic imagination.
